## Why Advertising Campaigns Need Proxies  
Running multiple campaigns or managing several ad accounts can trigger security alerts on platforms like Facebook, Google, or Instagram. These platforms often monitor IP addresses to detect suspicious activities, such as multiple accounts operated from the same IP, which can lead to account restrictions or bans.  
Proxies allow marketers to assign different IP addresses to each campaign or account, minimizing the risk of being flagged for policy violations. This separation is crucial for agencies and professionals handling numerous clients or running diverse campaigns simultaneously.  

## How Proxies Help in Ad Verification and Market Testing  
Ad verification is vital to ensure your ads appear in the right locations and to the intended audiences. Proxies enable advertisers to view and verify ads as they appear in various geographic regions by using IPs from those locations. This helps catch any discrepancies or fraudulent activity early.  
Additionally, proxies facilitate market testing by allowing advertisers to simulate user experiences in different countries. By using proxies with IP addresses from targeted regions, you can analyze how ads perform locally and optimize strategies accordingly.

## Choosing the Right Proxy for Advertising Management

You need a provider that offers a broad range of IP addresses to assign unique ones per account, ensuring security and reducing detection risks.
